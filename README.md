bit.ly/MaxCapacityApp

My friend Fernando is a security guard. He always has to check the maximum capacity in each store where he works. Since COVID, the maximum capacity of every store had been reduced. So, Fernando can't keep track of every change in each store where he works.

He told me that he's going to buy a counter on Amazon. But I offered my help because it is a big excuse to start coding and resolve my friend's problem.
So after a bunch of questions to my friend and inspired by the manual person counter, I decided to create the app with just two buttons. He will have to use the + button when a person goes inside the store and the button minus when one person leaves the store.

I thought it will be a great idea to create more buttons for making it quick with +-2 or +-4 for big groups but the first time when we tested this it was kind of stressful for Fernando.

So I noticed that it is even faster to tap four times on the "+" button, than checking at the screen looking for the +4 button and making sure that you didn't push another button instead of that one.
So after making sure that we are going to use these two buttons I decided to have the option to change the maximum capacity in each local. As the COVID laws are reducing or incrementing the maximum capacity depending on the situation, so taping the number of the maximum capacity Fernando would change the number.

I tried to do the javascript code as easily as possible, that's why aren't too many lines of code.
